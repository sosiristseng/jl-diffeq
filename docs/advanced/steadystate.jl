# Steady state solutions

Solving steady state solutions with `SteadyStateDiffEq.jl` for an ODE system is to find a combination of state variables such that their derivatives are all zeroes. Their are two ways:

- Running the ODE solver until a steady state is reached (`DynamicSS()` and `OrdinaryDiffEq.jl`)
- Using a root-finding algorithm to find a steady state (`SSRootfind()` and `NonlinearSolve.jl`)

# ## Defining a steady state problem
using SteadyStateDiffEq, OrdinaryDiffEq

model(u, p, t) = 1 - p * u

p = 1.0
u0 = 0.0
prob = SteadyStateProblem(model, u0, p)
alg = DynamicSS(Tsit5())

# Solve the problem. The result should be close to 1.0.
sol = solve(prob, alg)

# ## Modelingtoolkit solving nonlinear systems
# Use `NonlinearSolve.jl` and `NonlinearSystem()`.

]

@mtkbuild ns = NonlinearSystem(eqs, [x, y, z], [σ, ρ, β])

guess = [x => 1.0, y => 0.0, z => 0.0]
ps = [σ => 10.0, ρ => 26.0, β => 8 / 3]

sol = solve(prob, NewtonRaphson()) ## The results should be close to zeroes

    0 ~ u3 - hypot(u1, u2)
    0 ~ u4 - hypot(u2, u3)
    0 ~ u5 - hypot(u4, u1)
]

@mtkbuild sys = NonlinearSystem(eqs, [u1, u2, u3, u4, u5], [])

# You can simplify the problem using `structural_simplify()`.
# There will be only one state variable left. The solve can solve the problem faster.
prob = NonlinearProblem(sys, [u5 => 0.0])
sol = solve(prob, NewtonRaphson())

# The answer should be close to 1.6 and 1.0.

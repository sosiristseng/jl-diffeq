# Catalyst ODE examples

[Catalyst.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/) is a symbolic modeling package for analysis and high-performance simulation of chemical reaction networks.

## Repressilator

[Repressilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressilator) model consists of a biochemical reaction network with three components in a negative feedback loop.

# Define the reaction network
repressilator = @reaction_network begin
    hillr(P₃, α, K, n), ∅ --> m₁
    hillr(P₁, α, K, n), ∅ --> m₂
    hillr(P₂, α, K, n), ∅ --> m₃
    (δ, γ), m₁ ↔ ∅
    (δ, γ), m₂ ↔ ∅
    (δ, γ), m₃ ↔ ∅

    β, m₂ --> m₂ + P₂

# Reactions in the reaction network
reactions(repressilator)

# State variables in the reaction network
unknowns(repressilator)

# Parameters in the reaction network
parameters(repressilator)

# To setup parameters (`p`) and initial conditions (`u0`), you can use Julia symbols to map the values.
p = [:α => 0.5, :K => 40, :n => 2, :δ => log(2) / 120, :γ => 5e-3, :β => 20 * log(2) / 120, :μ => log(2) / 60]
u0 = [:m₁ => 0.0, :m₂ => 0.0, :m₃ => 0.0, :P₁ => 20.0, :P₂ => 0.0, :P₃ => 0.0]

# Or you can also use symbols from the reaction system with the `@unpack` macro (less error prone)
@unpack m₁, m₂, m₃, P₁, P₂, P₃, α, K, n, δ, γ, β, μ = repressilator
p = [α => 0.5, K => 40, n => 2, δ => log(2) / 120, γ => 5e-3, β => 20 * log(2) / 120, μ => log(2) / 60]
u0 = [m₁ => 0.0, m₂ => 0.0, m₃ => 0.0, P₁ => 20.0, P₂ => 0.0, P₃ => 0.0]

# Then we can solve this reaction network as an ODE problem
tspan = (0.0, 10000.0)
oprob = ODEProblem(repressilator, u0, tspan, p);
sol = solve(oprob)
plot(sol)

# Use extracted symbols for a phase plot
plot(sol, idxs=(P₁, P₂))

## Generating reaction systems programmatically

There are two ways to create a reaction for a `ReactionSystem`:

- `Reaction()` function.
- `@reaction` macro.

The `Reaction(rate, substrates, products)` function builds reactions.

To allow for other stoichiometric coefficients we also provide a five argument form: `Reaction(rate, substrates, products, substrate_stoichiometries, product_stoichiometries)`

## Conservation laws
We can use conservation laws to eliminate some unknown variables.
For example, in the chemical reaction `A + B <--> C`, given the initial concentrations of A, B, and C, the solver needs to find only one of [A], [B], and [C] instead of all three.

# Let's convert it to a system of ODEs, using the conservation laws to eliminate two species, leaving only one of them as the state variable.
# The conserved quantities will be denoted as `Γ`s
osys = convert(ODESystem, rn; remove_conserved=true) |> structural_simplify

# Only one (unknown) state variable need to be solved
unknowns(osys)

# The other two are constrained by conserved quantities
observed(osys)

# Solve the problem

# You can still trace the eliminated variable
